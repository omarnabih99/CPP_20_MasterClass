## Introduction

- Pointers are variables whose values are `Memory Addresses`.

- Normally, a variable directly contains a specific value. `A pointer, on the other hand, contains an address of a variable that contains a specific value.

- Pointer size depends on the archeticture of the platform, i.e. on the address bus size.

## Exercises

The exercises are organized into folders based on their respective topics or concepts. Each exercise typically includes a problem statement, implementation code file (`*.cpp`), header file ( `*.h` ), and source code file( `*.cpp` ). Some exercises may also include test cases or additional resources to help you solve them.

## Notebooks

Additionally, there are explanation notebooks available in this section to provide further insights and explanations on pointers-related concepts. These notebooks aim to clarify important concepts, offer tips and best practices, and provide additional examples to enhance your understanding of Pointers in C++.

## Getting Started

To get started with the array exercises:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to 01_Arrays folder.
3. Read the problem statement and revise the solution in the provided `*.cpp` file.
4. Test your solution and debug as needed.
5. Optionally, refer to the explanation notebooks for further insights and explanations.
