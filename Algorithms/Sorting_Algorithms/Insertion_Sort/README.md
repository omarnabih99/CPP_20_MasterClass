# Insertion Sort

## Steps to implement Insertion Sort

1. Start from the second element.

2. Store the element in a temp value.

3. Check if the element is smaller than all previous elements.

4. If smaller -> move the previous element to the next position.

5. If not smaller -> save the element in the temp variable to the empty position.

6. Repeat till the array becomes sorted.
