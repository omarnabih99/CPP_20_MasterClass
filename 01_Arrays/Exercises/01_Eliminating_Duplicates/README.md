# Eliminating duplicates

Your are given an array of size `collection_size`, containing integers, potentially including duplicates.

An example is:

```cpp
int data [] {1,2,4,5,1,8,2,3,6,1,4,2};
```

Your job is to write code that eliminates duplicates and print a message exactly like:

```sql
The collection contains 7 unique numbers, they are : 1 2 4 5 8 3 6
```

with a single space after the last element, in this case, a space after the 6.
