# The collection is sorted

Your job is to take in an array of integers and figure out if it is sorted in incremental order or not.

For example, if we have an input array:

```cpp
int data [] {1,2,4,5,8,12,13,16,71,92};
```

your code should figure out that the array (collection) is sorted in incrementing order.

If we have an input array
```cpp
int data [] {1,112,4,5,8,12,13,16,71,92};
```
your code should figure out that it is not sorted in incrementing order.

You will store your result in a bool variable called `sorted`. 

If the collection is sorted, you'll store in a true, if the collection is not sorted you'll store in a false.
