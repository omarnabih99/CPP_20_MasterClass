# Fortune Teller V2

This is the enhanced version of [04_Fortune_Teller_V1](https://github.com/omarnabih99/NTI-CPP/tree/main/01_Arrays/Exercises/04_Fortune_Teller_V1).

In this version, we used multi dimension character array as an array of literal strings instead of define each prediction as a single dimension array.

This reduced code size as we just used the generated number as an index to print the message instead of using switch case.
