# Hunt for vowels

Given an array of char types, your job is to hunt for vowels in that array and store the number of vowels in a given variable. For example if you input is

```cpp
char message[] {'T','h','e',' ','s','k','y',' ' ,'i','s',' ','b','l','u,'e',' ','m','y',' ','f','r','i','e,'n','d'};
```

your code should find that it contains 6 vowels and store the 6 is a specified `vowel_count` variable.

***Note***

The letter 'y' could either be treated as a vowel or consonant depending on the letters around it. It's mostly treated as a vowel in fast. However, for simplicity, this exercise assumes it's a consonant. As an exercise, you can write code that treats it as a vowel.
