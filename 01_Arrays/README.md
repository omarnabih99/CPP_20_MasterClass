## Introduction

Arrays are fundamental data structures in C++ that allow you to store multiple elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. Understanding arrays is essential for developing efficient algorithms and solving a wide range of programming problems.

In this section, you'll find a collection of exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of arrays in C++. These exercises cover various topics, including array declaration, initialization, accessing elements, performing operations, and implementing algorithms.

## Exercises

The exercises are organized into folders based on their respective topics or concepts. Each exercise typically includes a problem statement, implementation code file (`*.cpp`), header file ( `*.h` ), and source code file( `*.cpp` ). Some exercises may also include test cases or additional resources to help you solve them.

## Notebooks

Additionally, there are explanation notebooks available in this section to provide further insights and explanations on array-related concepts. These notebooks aim to clarify important concepts, offer tips and best practices, and provide additional examples to enhance your understanding of arrays in C++.

## Getting Started

To get started with the array exercises:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to 01_Arrays folder.
3. Read the problem statement and revise the solution in the provided `*.cpp` file.
4. Test your solution and debug as needed.
5. Optionally, refer to the explanation notebooks for further insights and explanations.
